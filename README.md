ABSTRACT:
Real Estate industry is dynamic in terms of the prices being fluctuated regularly. Itâ€™s one of the main area to apply the machine learning concepts to predict the prices of real estate depending upon the current situations and make out maximum accuracy for the same. The research paper mainly focus on to predicting the real valued prices for the places and the houses by applying the appropriate ML algorithms. The proposed article considers some essential aspects and parameters for calculating the prices of real estate property Also some more geographical and statistical techniques will be needed to predict the price of a house. The paper consist how the house pricing model works after using some machine learning techniques and algorithms. The use of the dataset in the proposed system from the reputed website helps to get the detailed analysis of the data points. Algorithms like Linear regression and sklearn are used to effectively increase the accuracy.
